            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a sixth-year student at Simon Fraser University in the MBB/CMPT (Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Computing Science) joint major program with a Certificate in Genomics. During my undergraduate studies, I have completed two co-op terms. I worked as a research assistant at Virogin Biotech in 2022 and in a laboratory co-op position at Bureau Veritas in 2024.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I volunteer at my church as a pianist in one of the choirs. This has given me the opportunity to sing/play at weddings and other local gigs.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include screaming my guts out at concerts, reading the latest romance novels trending on TikTok, and knitting/crocheting cute things.</p>
