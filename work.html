                    <h3><i>May 2024 - December 2024</i></h3>
                    <p>During my co-op at Bureau Veritas, I worked with the Preprocessing team which supports 
                        other departments by preparing samples for further analyses. For samples requiring organic analysis, 
                        I extracted environmental samples into glass vials using a top loading balance to obtain their weights. 
                        When scanning in new samples from sample logistics, I examined each test code assigned to a sample and 
                        determined what preparatory tasks must be performed. This could involve labelling samples, scooping samples 
                        that required overnight drying into tin trays before putting them into the oven, and communicating to other 
                        team members about immediate deadlines for certain samples. Using the company’s Laboratory Information Management 
                        System, I created worksheets for a specific test, recorded data such as the weights of extracted samples, 
                        logged the movement of samples between departments and storage, and entered instrument verification data. 
                        Once samples were prepared, I delivered the samples to other departments, ensuring that test deadlines were met.

                    <p>In my co-op as a research assistant at Virogin Biotech, I worked with the Pharmacology & Toxicology team where my 
                        main responsibilities were related to project management. I communicated between the in vivo and in vitro teams 
                        about the latest study updates through e-mails and a shared Google Sheet. I was also responsible for maintaining 
                        quality assurance records on our electronic lab notebook hosted on LabArchives, and drafting and reviewing documents 
                        such as the study protocol and standard operating procedures. In addition, I developed an Excel file that generated models 
                        for tumour growth data in mice. This file was designed as a template that could be applied to various in vivo studies. More 
                        recently, models generated from this template were featured in the 2023 publication titled

                    <p>In my position as a cast member at Landmark Cinemas, I aim to provide exceptional customer service to create an enjoyable 
                        theatre experience for our guests. When working in concession, I prepare concession items while following training procedures and 
                        proper safety protocols. Because of the fast-paced environment, I have become efficient in multi-tasking when taking guest orders, 
                        re-stocking, and communicating with other staff throughout a busy set. When working outside of concession, I am responsible for ensuring that 
                        movies are played on time and keeping different areas in the theatre clean and presentable. This means routinely cleaning and re-stocking 
                        items in the bathrooms, sweeping and mopping the lobby, and cleaning each theatre at the end of every movie by staying on top of the

                        information. My main task was to update the price tags on each car on a weekly basis. This involved accessing the latest pricing information
                        recorded on a shared Google Sheet, comparing these prices to the price tag listed on each car, and creating price tags to apply onto each car.
                        Additionally, I would assist in other tasks like adding stickers for promotional events and brushing snow off cars in the winter.
