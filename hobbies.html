            <p><b>Music</b></p>
            <p>I grew up learning how to sing and play instruments like the piano and the guitar. I still practice these skills by volunteering
                as a pianist in my church choir. This has given me the opportunity to play at weddings and other events. I have also performed at
                other local gigs with family members who also enjoy playing music.

            <p><b>Reading</b></p>
            <p>Ever since my childhood, I have been an avid reader. From Percy Jackson and The Hunger Games in elementary school to the Throne of Glass series in high school,
                I am able to track major events in my life through what I was reading at the time. Using Goodreads, I am able to track my reading progress and set reading goals.

            <p><b>Knitting and Crocheting</b></p>
            <p>I learned how to knit in my free time when I was in high school. Starting out with small accessories, I quickly was able to take on bigger projects like blankets and sweaters. 
                Soon after, I learned how to crochet. Check out some of the things I made below or at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rheanaknits/">this instagram page</a>!</p>
