# CMPT 276 Mini-Project: Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio website deployed on GitHub pages for my CMPT 276 mini-project.

### Website Wireframe

*Figure 1. Portfolio website wireframe developed on Figma*

I used Figma to develop a wireframe for my website. I developed the five pages (homepage, about page, work experience page, hobbies page, and sample projects page), with the sample projects page having 3 sections to represent a carousel I wanted to try implementing for that page.

The wireframe on Figma can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/design/XnQPadBy0fHIDZAwG5Vmz4/Mini-Project-Wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=lYShBfGfCY0gTP4B-1).
